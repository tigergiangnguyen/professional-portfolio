            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I was born in EA, Pennsyvania but move to Charlotte when I was 3 years old. Two years ago, I was a food manager at a restaurant
                but I was worn out because everyday was the same and I wasn't growing as a person. I transition into a supervisor position at Parking Management
                Company, we valet over 38 sites. If you live in Charlotte I valet at Steak48, Del Frisco, and Kimpton Hotel. I am a visual learner,
                it's easy for me to follow alone and copy what I'm seeing. I have experience in coding, back in high school I was in a class called
                Introduction to Software Development but I never touch HTML and CSS. The two hobbies I do in my spare time is playing trading card games and
                I also like to play video games mainly first person shooter. One of my dream job is to become a video game developer for EA games and with
                the help of UNCC coding bootcamp, That dream can happen!
