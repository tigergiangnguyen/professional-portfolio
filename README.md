## Description

I was given an assignment to create my own website of a portfolio about me. This assigment was on an even week meaning I 
was not given a starter code. Following the user story to have a basic requirment to satisfy the acceptance criteria. Creating this website has given me the opportunity to build as I process into the bootcamp to eventually using it to show off to potential hires. I enjoy seeing my html and css knowledge to build a website and it's never finish because there can be always more to change.

## Features about the website

    - clicking on the navigation bar has links that will scroll the page to appropriate section that was given

    - In the work history, there are image/gifs. Attach to those are links, click on those will redirect the page to Github with work histories that I did.

    - In the contact me, there are links to my account on Github and Gitlab. The email is a way to get in touch with me.

    - The website is mobile responsive. Changing the dimension will have an effect mostly to the boxes within the work history and to proof the effects, the header turns into a different color depending on the dimension.
